## üíª System Architecture

### üë®‚Äçüíª Architectural Design

The Insta Foodies Server follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, promoting the separation of concerns and ease of codebase maintenance. This design consists of three core components:

- Model: Handles communication with the database and data-related logic.
- View: Interfaces with the Android UI, managing layouts and user interface elements.
- View Model: Prepares data from the Model for the UI and contains UI-related logic.

### üì¶ Decomposition Description

The server is modularized into several distinct modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

1. **User Authentication and Registration:** Manages user registration, authentication, and secure processes, including verification emails.
2. **Post Creation and Editing:** Handles post creation, editing, and management, enabling image uploads, descriptions, and structured recipe data.
3. **Feed Display and Navigation:** Displays user feeds with chronological posts and allows interactions such as likes, comments, and shares.
4. **User Profile and Settings:** Manages user profiles, settings, and customization.
5. **Search Functionality:** Implements user search queries, organizes search results, and provides auto-complete suggestions.
6. **Notifications:** Sends notifications for interactions related to user activities and preferences.
7. **Chat Messaging:** Enables real-time chat, individual and group messaging, multimedia sharing, and message history.
8. **Content Recognition and Reporting:** Utilizes AI for object detection to identify recognizable food content in posts, managing reporting and moderation.
9. **Recipe Web Scraping and Integration:** Fetches external recipes, integrates them into the app's database, and displays them seamlessly.
10. **Multi-Threaded Server and Load Balancing:** Manages the application's logic using a multi-threaded server architecture and load balancing through NGINX.

### üé® Design Rationale

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern was selected for its ability to separate concerns and ensure a well-organized codebase. Decomposing the application into modules enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Each module serves a specific purpose, fostering collaboration and allowing new features to be seamlessly integrated.

## üìä Data Design
