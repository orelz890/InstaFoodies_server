## üíª System Architecture

Combination of different architectural patterns and concepts to achieve a specific application's goals. While it doesn't precisely fit into any single established pattern, it incorporates several principles to create a custom solution:


**Task Queue Architecture:**
- This pattern focuses on efficiently distributing tasks among available workers, allowing for parallel processing and scalability.


**Microservices-like Separation of Responsibilities:**
- Division of components similar to microservices - separation of concerns.


**Controller Pattern:**
- The controller, processes incoming requests, manages the flow of data, and delegates tasks.


**Server-Client Model:**
- Clients make requests to the server, which manages the task distribution and worker responses.


**Asynchronous Event-Driven Processing:**
- The architecture focus on queuing tasks and asynchronous processing is reminiscent of event-driven architectures. Events (tasks) are queued and processed independently when resources are available.


**Distributed Processing:**
- The delegation of tasks to worker components can be considered a form of distributed processing, distributing computation across multiple units to achieve efficiency.




### üë®‚Äçüíª Architectural Design

The Insta Foodies Server follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, promoting the separation of concerns and ease of codebase maintenance. This design consists of three core components:

- Model: Handles communication with the database and data-related logic.
- View: Interfaces with the Android UI, managing layouts and user interface elements.
- View Model: Prepares data from the Model for the UI and contains UI-related logic.

### üì¶ Decomposition Description

The server is modularized into several distinct modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

1. **User Authentication and Registration:** Manages user registration, authentication, and secure processes, including verification emails.
2. **Post Creation and Editing:** Handles post creation, editing, and management, enabling image uploads, descriptions, and structured recipe data.
3. **Feed Display and Navigation:** Displays user feeds with chronological posts and allows interactions such as likes, comments, and shares.
4. **User Profile and Settings:** Manages user profiles, settings, and customization.
5. **Search Functionality:** Implements user search queries, organizes search results, and provides auto-complete suggestions.
6. **Notifications:** Sends notifications for interactions related to user activities and preferences.
7. **Chat Messaging:** Enables real-time chat, individual and group messaging, multimedia sharing, and message history.
8. **Content Recognition and Reporting:** Utilizes AI for object detection to identify recognizable food content in posts, managing reporting and moderation.
9. **Recipe Web Scraping and Integration:** Fetches external recipes, integrates them into the app's database, and displays them seamlessly.
10. **Multi-Threaded Server and Load Balancing:** Manages the application's logic using a multi-threaded server architecture and load balancing through NGINX.

### üé® Design Rationale

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern was selected for its ability to separate concerns and ensure a well-organized codebase. Decomposing the application into modules enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Each module serves a specific purpose, fostering collaboration and allowing new features to be seamlessly integrated.

## üìä Data Design

### üìã Data Description

The server utilizes either Firebase or SQLite as the database to store various types of data relevant to the Insta Foodies app:

- Post Information: Stores comprehensive post data, encompassing captions, ingredients, instructions, images, and timestamps.
- User Feed: Stores references to posts from followed users, contributing to the user's personalized feed.
- User Liked Posts: Tracks references to posts that a user has liked, enhancing the user's engagement with content.
- Reported Posts: Manages references to posts flagged by the content recognition module, facilitating content moderation.
- Utils: Provides a collection for maintaining data such as ingredient options, promoting consistency.

### üìï Data Dictionary

The Insta Foodies Server utilizes the following tables or collections to store data:


1. User information - A table or collection that stores the relationship between users.
2. User Account information ‚Äì A table or collection storing account information.
3. Post information - A table or collection that stores posts information.
4. User feed - A table or collection storing references to the user's followings posts.
5. User-liked posts - A table or collection storing references to posts he/she liked.
6. Reported posts ‚Äì - A table or collection storing references to MLKIT reported posts.
7. Utils ‚Äì A table or collection storing Ingredients options list.

   - Open the `key.js` file and paste the generated key.

6. Install Nginx (web server similar to Apache):
    - Ubuntu: 
      ```sh
      sudo apt install nginx
      ```
    - Windows: Watch the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-3o3Yz4GvY).
    - Full Nginx tutorial: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PrT5uKszQo)

7. Using Nginx as a load balancer:
    - Watch the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X4ZO5tO7Co&list=PLaiZP3KJsJOoFP4JwV_GlRfjmz-w54d1K&index=4)
    - General commands:
        - Check Nginx configuration: `nginx -t`
        - Start Nginx: `start nginx`
        - Reload Nginx: `nginx -s reload`

8. Install OpenSSL on Windows: [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBa87N_BZ4s)

### ‚öô Configuration

- To run the server with Nodemon:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

- To run the server without Nodemon:
    ```sh
    node .\server.js
    ```

### ‚ñ∂ Usage

### Running Without PM2

- For more details, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oykl1Ih9pMg&list=PLatLJHenaEliXO6AVHwu_5nejsebpNFfB&index=5)

1. Install PM2 (process manager):
    ```sh
    npm install -g pm2
    ```

2. Start the server with PM2:
    ```sh
    pm2 start server.js
    ```

3. Additional commands:
    ```sh
    pm2 status
    pm2 restart server.js
    pm2 stop server.js
    pm2 logs
    pm2 flush
    ```

4. To run multiple servers on different ports:
    - Install cross-env:
      ```sh
      npm install --save-dev cross-env
      ```
    - Start servers with different ports:
      ```sh
      npx cross-env PORT=3000 pm2 start --name server1 server.js
      ```

5. Save PM2 configuration:
    ```sh
    pm2 save
    ```

This script: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` allows running scripts without permanently changing the system's execution policy.
